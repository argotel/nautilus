# This is a simple Unix script that will setup Nautilus to
# listen for a forthcoming internet connection.
#
# Sometimes coder/cipher combinations make connections a pain.
# This script makes life a little easier.
#
# As is the Unix standard, Nautilus exit()'s with a 0 (zero)
# after a successful session.  Errors return non-zero.
# "$?" is the success of the last command executed.
#
# Modify this script as appropriate.  It is only intended
# as an example.
