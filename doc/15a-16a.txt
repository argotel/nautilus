		/*** NO CRYPTO CODE HAS CHANGED ***/

doc/		
INSTALL         Added explaination of RSAREF location in makefile.unx.
nautilus.1      New man page.
nautilus.doc	Updated with 28.8/Digital Telephony Act/DSS/Schneier stuff.
TODO		Merged stuff from Bill and Dave's excellent wishlists.

src/
cli.c           Added support for RING_FILE.
		Complain if PlayVoice() cannot access a *.v file.
		Fixed problem displaying 38400 DTE on DOS (16-bit) machines
                  and tightened memory security when entering passphrases.
init.c		Added decoding to CoderSpeedTest() (fixing SP85 bug introduced
		  in 1.0a) and added support for LOGON_FILE parameter.
logon.v		Conservatively cut out a little noise from the start and end
		  (saving 6k).
makefile.unx	Added support for Unix 'make install' to install to
		  /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man/man1.
		Documented 'make clean'.
		Generalized location of RSAREF.
nautilus.h      Added verbose parameter to InitAudio().
		Added RING_FILE and LOGON_FILE and fix to really use
		  UPGRADE_FILE in .cfg.
nautilus.cfg	Example configuration script.
nautilus_answer	New Unix script to listen for a connection.
pc-audio.c      Added verbose parameter to InitAudio()
sha.c		A new version of SHA (SHA-1) which contains endian-specific
		  code to produce endian-independent hashes.  This fixes
		  the bug causing different DH verification values between
		  Intel (little-endian) and Sun (big-endian) machines.
sp1bit.c	Pitiful initialization optimization.
unix.c          Added verbose parameter to InitAudio()
		Changed Expected/Desired audio params verbosity to a table to
		  save vertical screen space.  Removed unused variables.
versions.c	Fixed bug that would not allow connection to older version.
		Fixed bug that ignored UPGRADE_FILE in the .cfg

lpc10/
lpc10/analys.c	1-line header documentation fix from Bill.
lpc10/bsynz.c	Simplified indexing and looping.
lpc10/decode.c	1-line header documentation fix from Bill.
lpc10/difmag.c	Elimination of variables and a decision-reduction.
lpc10/dyptrk.c	Initialization and indexing calculation reduction.
lpc10/energy.c	Lame f2c optimization with variable 'speech' (now index 0).
lpc10/mload.c	Removed simple middle-man variable.
lpc10/lpfile.c	Just made it look like C (one big addition).
lpc10/onset.c	Removed middle-man variable, peoffset, and simplified indexing.
lpc10/synths.c	Fixed ported FORTRAN initialization.
lpc10/vparms.c	Simplified indexing and changed unnecessary doublereal
		  conversions to real.

GENERAL CHANGES:

New directory structure including doc/ and src/

New makefiles allow for compiling with GCC under DOS.
