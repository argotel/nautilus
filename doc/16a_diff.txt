This file contains the descriptions of all 1.6a deviations from 1.5d.

src/
cli.c		Complain if PlayVoice() cannot access a *.v file.
makefile.unx	Added support for Unix 'make install' to install to
		/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man/man1.
nautilus_answer	New Unix script to listen for a connection.
sha.c		A new version of SHA-1 which contains endian-specific
		code to produce endian-independent hashes.  This fixes
		the bug causing different DH verification values when
		connecting Intel (little-endian) and Sun (big-endian)
		machines.
versions.c	Fixed bug that would not allow connection to older version.


GENERAL CHANGES:

New makefiles allow for compiling with GCC under DOS.

The "unix" #ifdef is now called "UNIX", due to a bug in djgpp 2.0 /
gcc 2.7.2 preprocessor as compiled for DOS, which automatically #defines
"unix", even though it is a DOS release.  The downside to this is that
before we could rely on "unix" to be automatically defined for us by the
preprocessor, and now we must set "UNIX" ourselves in the makefiles.
