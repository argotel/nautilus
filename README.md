Nautilus Software Secure Phone

This software was originally written to run on SunOS, Linux, and MS-DOS circa 1993.

Over the years it was ported to several other platforms, including Solaris and more recent versions of Linux.

For the last 10+ years, it was maintained by my friends at http://nautilus.berlios.de/

Recently, we have decided to do a complete re-write of Nautilus to bring it in line with modern software.
It will have a GUI, allow full-duplex audio conversations, allow keyboard-to-keyboard messaging, and even
run on your smartphone.  On top of this, the encryption algorithms and protocols will be updated to reflect
the current state of the art, including the use of AES-256, and new key exchange algorithms.

In the meantime, if you would like to get the old code to work, please see the the files install.dos and
install.unx for build instructions.  If you want to make it run under newer versions of Ubuntu, please
note that you will need to run it with the 'padsp' command so that it will see your audio device.

For user convenience, I have added the Windows executable nautilus.exe.  This runs on recent versions of
Windows including Windows XP and Windows 7.  You will need to run it from the command line, or create a
.bat file to run it for you from the Desktop.
